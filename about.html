              When Mama Rose first came to the U.S. in her early 20s from
              Palermo, Sicily in 1964, she brought her love for her family and
              her love of food with her. She worked her way up from dishwasher
              to chef in restaurants all throughout northern California for many
              years. Mama Rose always knew she ultimately wanted to share her
              family’s recipes and combined her two loves, her family and food,
              and open her own establishment.

              In 1991 Mama Rose’s Family Kitchen was established by Mama Rose
              and her two daughters Francesca and Isabella, and is still run by
              the daughters today. With elevated food and Mama Rose making every
              customer feel like part of her family, it is no wonder Mama Rose’s
              Family Kitchen has proudly served the northern California
              communities for over 30 years.

              Even now at 80 years old, Mama Rose stays very involved in the
              business, and still loves to teach cooking classes. “The best part
              of this whole business is I get to see my family every day, my
              children, my grandchildren, and now even my great grandchildren,
              we all work here.” – Mama Rose. Mama Rose’s five grandchildren are
              now moving Mama’s into a new modern era, all by keeping the
              spirit, creativity, and high standards their grandmother instilled
              in them all their lives.
